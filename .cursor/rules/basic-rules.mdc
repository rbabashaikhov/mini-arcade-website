# Cursor Rules — basic-rules.mdc

# Project: Mini Arcade (static)
- Only vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks, no build tools, no npm.
- No external CDNs (fonts, libs). Use system fonts only.
- Keep everything runnable as static files under /public.
- All game pages must be standalone in /public/games/<slug>/index.html with local style.css and game.js.
- UI style: neo-minimal, light theme, teal accent. Subtle shadows, soft borders, rounded corners.
- Maintain consistent spacing scale and component styles across the launcher and games.
- No tracking/logging/analytics, no network “masking” logic, no hidden endpoints.
- Prefer small, readable files. Avoid monolithic JS > 600 lines; split logically if needed.
- Always update games.json when adding/removing games.
- Restart for launcher should reload iframe src; avoid complex messaging until requested.
